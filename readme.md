## 📌 The Problem

🚨 **65-70% of children (ages 5-15) in rural India** — particularly in **Jammu & Kashmir, UP, Bihar, Rajasthan, and the North-East** — face severe educational inequality due to:

- 📖 Lack of interactive, structured curriculum.
- 🏚️ Poor learning environments & untrained teachers.
- 📶 Limited or **no internet access** for self-learning.
- ❌ No clear, accessible guidance on what or how to study.
