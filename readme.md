# 🚀 Pragati — Empowering Rural India Through Accessible Learning 📚✨

## 🌟 Inspiration
The idea for **Pragati** was born out of witnessing the glaring educational divide in rural India. Millions of children grow up without access to quality education because of poor infrastructure, a lack of trained teachers, and minimal internet connectivity. We envisioned a platform that would bridge this gap — offering these students high-quality, accessible, and inclusive learning resources, regardless of where they live or what device they own.


## 📌 The Problem
**65-70% of children (ages 5-15) in rural India**, especially in J&K, UP, Bihar, Rajasthan, and the North-East, lack quality education due to:

- 📖 Minimal interactive teaching & structured curriculum.
- 🏫 Poor learning environments & untrained teachers.
- 🌐 Limited or no internet access for self-learning and no guidance on how or what to study.

### ⚠️ The Result?
Even motivated students struggle, limiting their future opportunities and continuing the cycle of educational inequity.
