## Pragati - Empowering Rural India Through Accessible Learning

### üî¥The Problem
65-70% of children (ages 5-15) in rural India, especially in J&K, UP, Bihar, Rajasthan, and the North-East, lack quality education due to:
 1. Minimal interactive teaching & structured curriculum.
 2. Poor learning environments & untrained teachers.
